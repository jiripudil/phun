**Modern functional collection utilities for PHP.** Phun is a collection of functions that facilitate working with collections in PHP in a functional programming paradigm.

Phun provides a set of pure, strongly typed functions that work with collections. In many places, Phun assumes these collections are lists, but provides a `-WithKeys()` variant of each function where it makes sense.
